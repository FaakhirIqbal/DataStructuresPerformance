## Overview

The task at hand involves creating code to assess the reading level of a given text using the Flesch Readability Score. This score, devised by author Rudolf Flesch, serves as a metric to estimate the readability of a piece of text by considering factors such as the number of sentences, words, and syllables within the text. A higher Flesch score suggests that the text is easier to comprehend, while a lower score indicates a more intricate or complex piece of writing.
